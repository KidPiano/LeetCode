# Subtree of Another Tree 

## Approach 1: Brute Force
The algorithm is simple: for every node in the big tree (s), check if it is the same as the small tree (t):
- If the current node is equal to the small tree, return true
- Otherwise, check if the current node's left child is equal to the small tree, and then check if the current node's right child is equal to the small tree


## Approach 2: Brute Force Optimizations

## Approach 3: Reduction to Substring Problem (Attempt 1: String, 

## Approach 4: Reduction to Substring Problem (Attempt 2: StringBuffer, indexOf)

## Approach 5: Reduction to Substring Problem (Attempt 3: StringBuffer, KMP)
